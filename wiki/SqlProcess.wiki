== Transact SQL to MySQL translation ==
Due to the history of iSanté (that started with a Microsoft Trasnact SQL Database), there was a need to create a translation tool from Transact SQL to MySQL.

Some legacy code still uses the Transact SQL paradigm (query executed with dbQuery()).

The translator is written in a language called Haskell and implemented as a PHP extension.

There are two files related to this:
sqlProcess/README.txt
sqlProcess/index.php

The first file has a summary of all the kinds of things that the translator does to input SQL statements. The second is a file you can access in your web browser that let's you manually translate any given SQL statement.

When you look in the application code some queries get processed through the translator and some do not. If the query is executed by database()->query() or any other method of database() it is not being translated. If a query executed by dbQuery() it is being translated.
