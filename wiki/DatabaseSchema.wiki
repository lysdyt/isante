#summary Description of the database architecture of iSante.

= Introduction =

iSante has been built in a few step.
  * The first one was where the application basically relied on one very big table, much like an excel sheet.
  * The second one was related to normalization that made the architecture more rational
  * the third one consists in bringing iSante closer to the openMRS http://openmrs.org/ concept model.
