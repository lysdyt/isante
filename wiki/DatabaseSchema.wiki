#summary Description of the database architecture of iSante.

= Introduction =

iSante has been built in a few step.
  * Initially, the database consisted of a large number of de-normalized tables roughly corresponding to the forms and sections of forms required by the application.
  * The second one was related to normalization that made the architecture more rational
  * the third one consists in bringing iSante closer to the openMRS http://openmrs.org/ concept model.
